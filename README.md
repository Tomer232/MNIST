# MNIST Digit Recognizer

An interactive Python application that recognizes handwritten digits using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. The application features a drawing canvas where users can draw digits and receive real-time predictions with confidence percentages. Built with TensorFlow for machine learning and Pygame for the graphical interface.

Train the model by running `main.py`, then launch the interactive drawing interface with `digit_drawer.py`. The interface displays predictions and confidence scores as you draw digits on a 280x280 canvas. Future implementation will convert this to a web application for deployment on a personal website using TensorFlow.js.
